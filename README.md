## Fit Some Infectious Disease Models to a Classroom Disease Epidemic Simulation, the 'Handshake' Disease. 

#### The ‘Handshake’ disease is a simulated disease where the disease is transmitted by handshakes. For detailed information about the classroom activity, see webpage:

#### Anthony and I have coded up this activity using Javascript and the HTML page is as follows: 
#### https://awmorp.github.io/handshake/test.html. 

#### In this project, I will model the progression of the handshake disease using ODE (ordinary differential equation) models. In particular, based on the nature of the 'handshake' game, I will investigate how well the classic SIR as well as SEIR models describe the progression of the disease, and explore variants of the them which may give a better fit. This involves mathematical modelling, numerical solving of ODEs, and model fitting using MATLAB.
