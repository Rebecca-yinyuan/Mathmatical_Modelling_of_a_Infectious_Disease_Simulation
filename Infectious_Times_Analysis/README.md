### It seems that there exists some correlation between the time at which people become infected and the number of timesteps for which they stay in the  Infectious group. 

### This correlation is important since it can provide us some information about: 
### 1). The underlying explanation of the behaviors of different parameters, such as Beta(the transmission rate) and Gamma(the recovery rate);
### 2). The inherent nature of the 'Handshake Disease'. 

### This folder includes some analysis which try to study the correlation.
